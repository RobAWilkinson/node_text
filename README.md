# Codesmithers Unite!!

###OUr goal in this challenge is to create a text based adventure game that allows users to test their javascript knowledge!

###Steps

1. `npm install` to download all the dependencies
2. open up the empty file `game.js` and start writing our code in there
3. theres a package called `readline` in there, do a little research on its methods and check it out
4. `#question` is a good place to start
5. Run the tests! `npm test`
6. Write our output by using `terminal.write` rather than console log
